# This document is only a placeholder file.
# If you need to edit English text,
# please edit the messages.properties file.
#
# Although the messages.properties file uses English,
# it's important to note that:
#
#   messages.properties == root language,
#   messages.properties != English.
#
# When users want to switch to English,
# UResourceBundle actually looks for messages_en.properties,
# which is this file.
#
# Without this file,
# UResourceBundle will search for the language file
# corresponding to the operating system's language.
#
# If found, it will use that language file,
# causing users who want to switch to English to
# always revert back to the operating system's language.
#
# Since this file does not contain any usable indexes,
# ResourceBundle will look for English indexes 
# in messages.properties again.
